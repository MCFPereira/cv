  thesis title: A simulation perspective on DNA condensation in bacterial and
human cells.
  Brief Synopsis of Research: DNA isolated in its thread-like form can be two to three orders of magnitude longer
than the cell in which it is embedded. Despite numerous studies into cellular
processes, the mechanisms that lead to the condensation of DNA molecules are still
not fully understood. We developed a coarse-grained polymer physics model to
study the condensation of chromosomes in two different systems: bacterial and
human tissue cells.
  Research Interests: My current research aims at understanding the mechanisms responsible for the
large-scale DNA folding and structure.
